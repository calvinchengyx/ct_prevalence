A review by the Department of Defense found that in the 1980s, an Air Force colonel visited a Nevada bar near Area 51 and gave the owner fabricated photos of flying saucers near the secret government base, according to a review of the 2024 report by the Wall Street Journal. The incident renewed local fervor over UFOs, with the now-retired colonel confessing to Pentagon investigators that he was on an official mission to spread disinformation and hide the true purpose of the site, where the government was testing the first-ever stealth warplane, the F-117 Nighthawk. The military reasoned that the best way to keep its new technology hidden from the Soviet Unions prying eye during the Cold War was to bury it amid the trove of conspiracy theories surrounding Area 51, investigators found. The incident is just one of several where government agencies allegedly played up Americas UFO mythology for the purpose of protecting its military assets, according to the 2024 report. Other military attempts to obscure secret projects with conspiracy theories were not made public. Sean Kirkpatrick, the first director of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), was the man tasked by the government to dissect countless UFO theories in 2022. As his office probed decades of documents, memos and messages across the Defense Department, he found several conspiracy theories that circled back to the Pentagon itself. In one instance, Kirkpatricks team found that the Air Force hazed members with briefings introducing them to a fake Yankee Blue unit that purported investigated alien aircraft. The briefings came with a direct order never to mention the details to anyone, with many of the targets of the prank never learning it was all a ruse, according to interviews with Kirkpatricks team. The bizarre practice was still taking place during the investigation, with the Pentagon eventually sending an order across the DOD in 2023 to finally put an end to it. It remains unclear why officials presented subordinates with the fake briefings, with rumors speculating it could have been used as a loyalty test or to spread misinformation. Kirkpatrick also found that the government deliberately left people in the dark when they witnessed secret military projects, according to the WSJ. Robert Salas, a former Air Force captain, was one of those people. Salas claims he witnessed a UFO descend over a nuclear missile testing site in Montana in 1967. During the event, a flashing light was able to disable all 10 nuclear missiles at the bunker, along with all electrical systems. He was ordered to never discuss what he saw, with Salas maintaining that he witnessed alien visitors chiming in on the Cold War. Kirkpatricks team, however, discovered that Salas was never told that what he actually saw was a test of a fledging electromagnetic pulse test to see if American silos could withstand the radiation of atomic weapons and retaliate if the Soviet Union ever attacked first. With the test failing, officials decided that it was best no one knew the secret of the vulnerability, so Salas and the other witnesses were intentionally left in the dark to make their own conclusions. The DOD has acknowledged that not everything has been made public about the AAROs discoveries, but the military claims it will be more transparent in its follow up report scheduled for later this year.

The Journalsarticle, while admitting to Pentagon-orchestrated disinformation, misleads by framing credible UAP incidents as mere pranks or misidentifications, citing absurd claims of hazing rituals like Yankee Blue and fake Special Access Programs (SAPs) involving fabricated non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). These distractions must not divert Congress from the real issue: the Air Forces central role in a deliberate cover-up of UAP evidence, dating back to Project Sign in 1947 and continuing through modern efforts to obstruct transparency, as repeatedly articulated by former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Christopher Mellon. The WSJ article alleges the Air Force seeded false UFO/UAP stories to conceal classified programs, such as the F-117 Nighthawk, a fact long suspected by UFO/UAP researchers. However, it goes further, suggesting that significant UFO/UAP incidents, including those involving nuclear weapons facilities and whistleblower testimonies, are products of hazing, misunderstandings, or deliberate myths. The claim that Yankee Blue, a supposed hazing ritual involving fake briefings on an alien investigation unit, persisted until 2023 is implausible and lacks substantiation. Similarly, the notion of Air Force personnel signing fake NDAs for nonexistent SAPs strains credulity, serving to trivialize credible reports from whistleblowers like David Gruschand Robert Salas (@keptycho). These narratives appear designed to muddy the waters and discredit serious inquiry into UFO/UAP, particularly by Congress. Congress must not be swayed by such tactics. The WSJ, wittingly or unwittingly, appears to have been manipulated to propagate a narrative that aligns with the Air Forces agenda, echoing the tactics of Operation Mockingbird, a Cold War-era CIA program that infiltrated media to shape public opinion, as documented in NPIs white paper, Disinformation: The U.S. Governments Suppression of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena and Advanced Science. The WSJs selective reporting, amplifying distractions while ignoring evidence like the @ExploreSCU for UAP Studies (SCU) 2023 UAP Pattern Recognition Study, and the near-simultaneous publication of a New York Post article on June 8, 2025, similar to the WSJ piece, suggests a coordinated effort to control the UFO/UAP narrative, a modern continuation of Mockingbirds legacy. As NPIs June 7, 2025 rebuttal argued, the WSJs framing is a form of gaslighting, admitting past deception while dismissing current evidence to maintain Air Force control, perpetuating a stigma that has stifled scientific progress and public trust for nearly eight decades. Indeed, the Air Forces involvement in UFO/UAP disinformation began with Project Sign (19471949), the first official U.S. investigation into flying discs. Despite early findings suggesting possible extraterrestrial origins, the Air Force suppressed these conclusions, as seen in the rejection of Signs Estimate of the Situation report. This set the stage for Project Grudge (19491952), which prioritized debunking over inquiry, and Project Blue Book(19521969), which attempted to explain away thousands of sightings, many with ridiculous false explanations and concealed inexplicable cases in a still-classified section. The 1953 Robertson Panel, convened under Air Force oversight, explicitly recommended stigmatizing UAP reports to reduce public interest, a strategy that shaped media coverage and scientific discourse for decades. The Air Forces disinformation campaign continues today, as evidenced by its alleged obstruction of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (@DoD_AARO) and congressional oversight of UFO/UAP issues. It should be noted, ironically, that the sources for the WSJ article were primarily AARO, AAROs former director, Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, and Susan Gough, the Strategic Planner and Spokesperson for the Department of Defense and AARO who has been assigned the UFO/UAP portfolio and is well-versed in military Psychological Operations (PSYOPS). In other words, AARO and the Pentagon are also engaging in disinformation in coordination with the Air Force. This fact is entirely relevant to the allegations in the article that the Air Force and AARO conspired to omit critical details from its 2024 Historical Record Report, alleging it was to protect classified programs and avoid embarrassment, revelations that corroborate accusations in recent years by @ChrisKMellon. Mellon, a leading advocate for UFO/UAP transparency, has repeatedly criticized the Air Force for withholding data, perpetuating stigma, and undermining national security. In his February 2022 Debrief article, he noted the Air Forces failure to contribute to the Director of National Intelligences 2021 UAP report (which, for the first time, acknowledged UAP are real) despite tracking thousands of incidents from 2004 to 2021. In another article in The Hillin May 2022, Mellon highlighted the Air Forces silence on cases like UAP interference with nuclear missiles, and in February 2025, he cited the Air Forces refusal to share data on the 2023 Langley Air Force Base drone incursions, warning that such secrecy risks misidentifying genuine threats. Mellons accusations align with our findings here at the New Paradigm Institute. The 2024 AARO reports minimization of whistleblower testimonies, such as Gruschs claims of ET/NHI and recovered materials, reflects the Air Forces influence on the downplaying of evidence. The UAP Task Forces 2020 UAP Security Classification Guide, which over-classifies UAP data, prohibits the release of any and all photos and videos of UAP. Again, the SCUs 2023 UAP Pattern Recognition Study, which found statistically significant UAP activity near U.S. nuclear weapons sites from 1945 to 1975, contradicts the Air Forces narrative yet was ignored by the WSJ, further suggesting its manipulation. Congress must approach any investigation of the Air Force with eyes wide open, recognizing its role as a primary architect of UFO/UAP disinformation since 1947. The WSJ article, while exposing some truths, appears to be itself a symptom of this campaign, diverting attention from credible evidence and potentially serving as a modern vehicle for Mockingbird-like tactics. Congress cannot afford to be distracted by tales of hazing or fake NDAs when the Air Forces actions have eroded public trust, stalled scientific inquiry, and potentially compromised national security. We urge Congress to take the following actions to end this 80-year secrecy regime: Pass the UAP Disclosure Act:Enact the UAP Disclosure Act in the current legislative session to mandate the declassification and public release of UAP-related records, ensuring transparency and accountability for the American people. Conduct a Comprehensive Congressional Investigation:Investigate the Air Forces historical and ongoing disinformation, including its role in Project Sign, Project Grudge, the Robertson Panel, the Condon Committee, Project Blue Book, and media manipulation, as well as overclassification abuse. Demand Full Disclosure:Require the Air Force to release all UAP data, including sensor records from incidents like the 2023 Langley incursions and historical cases like Malmstrom, to Congress. Protect Whistleblowers:Strengthen protections for individuals whose testimonies expose Air Force suppression. Engage the Public in the Pursuit of Truth:Convene open hearings to examine Air Force disinformation, inviting experts like Chris Mellon and affected military personnel to testify, and encourage public participation. The Air Forces disinformation, amplified by the WSJs manipulated narrative, is not a relic of the Cold War but an active barrier to truth in 2025. Congress has a moral and constitutional duty to uncover the reality of UFO/UAP, which may involve advanced technology or NHI with profound implications for humanity. The American public, galvanized by disclosures from Mellon, Grusch, and others, demands accountability. We call on every citizen to contact their elected representatives and support NPIs mission for transparency by visiting our website and taking action: Also, we invite you to join our grassroots mobilization, Citizens for Disclosure:""]","0, ufo, aliens, area, 51",3665

Because the California Marxist Democrats need illegal aliens to maintain the fiction of their Democrat majority. They need those illegal voters for their election fraud to continue. Absolutely no other reason', 'Aside from this being ONE of the reasons which is explained well in this video below OF WHY the anti American Flag burning Scumbag democrat cultists want illegal aliens here, Ill give you the other two reasons: 2.) To REPLACE Americans with foreigners who Hate America-just like those garbage heaps burning our Flags in la and waving mexican flags! Americans-the vast majority, arent Stupid enough to fall for voting for democrat Cultists who Hate America and are actively destroying it! They want them to come here en mass so its too difficult to mass deport them, because democrats have their activists on the court feverishly blocking their deportationsILLEGALLY, so they can KEEP them here, translating to more political power! The anti American Flag burning Hog wallowing democrat Cult Hate Americans, and have abandoned their own constituents FOR illegal aliens, kissing their asses, putting them up in luxurious, 5 star hotels and accommodation, giving them the parks up until recently enjoyed by the citizens to have and enjoy with their families until democrats gave them to the illegal aliens! So the democrats have THEIR constituents sleeping on sidewalks as homeless, while these foreigner , anti American invaders get the Red Carpet treatment-to include money on credit cards, social services, medical care, drivers licenses and SS numbers! This isnt a conspiracy theory, its a Fact! Its a conspiracy by the democrat cult to ditch American voters with those who Hate America as they do, wanting to turn the United States into a third world shitholewhich is in complete alignment with what the garbage heap anti American democrats want badly-because theyre a cult of communists who cry for revolution just like the marxists they are! Theyre always crying about SOMETHING, arent they Ladies and Gentlemen! Theyre NEVER happy-even when theyre winning with ruining our American Culture, when they control all Branches of Government, hollyweird and the entertainment industry, the media, the financial institutions, and the universities and education systemtheyre STILL MISERABLE, unbearable MALCONTENTS! Theyre just on to THE NEXT GRIEVANCE! Manufactured, phoney, insincere outrage! Theyre addicted to grievances! When there arent problems-they manufacture them-just look at obama creating the racial divide problem. There werent problems before he told America they should have them! This created lots of hoaxes, jussie swollet being just one of scores! 3. Illegal Aliens HAVE VOTEDunlike what democrats said-DoGE and other government agencies have confirmed that MILLIONS of illegal aliens have voted in our elections, and thats no secret since california made it ILLEGAL To ask for proof of citizenship to vote-which is against Federal Laws! So theres your 3 reasons the anti American Flag burning Scumbag domestic terrorist democrat cult want illegal aliens here so badly! To recap: 1.) They affect the Census, which gives democrat cultists more (illegal) representation and seats in Congress. 2.) It replaces Americans with anti Americans who Hate America and refuse to assimilate, so revolution is easier. 3.) More votes for the democrat cult!', ""WHATS UP, AMERICA? ICE Raided a Food Plant. Americans Rushed to Apply for Opened-Up Jobs. Catherine Salgado 10:20 AM on June 17, 2025 Democrats want you to believe only illegal aliens would take farming, factory, hotel, and restaurant jobs. They're flat out lying. This past week, ICE raided Glenn Valley Foods, resulting in the biggest worksite immigration raid in Nebraskas history. Dozens of illegal aliens who were employed at the meat-packing plant were removed for deportation, according to Revolver. And this enforcement of immigration law had an interesting result that Democrats would hate to admit: Americans immediately showed up to apply for the open jobs. It is fascinating how Democrats are using the exact same rhetoric in defense of illegal immigration that they used in the 19th century to defend slavery. Democrat Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said on CNN, I don't think the President understands that we have entire sectors of our economy that cannot function without immigrant labor. Replace immigrant with slave and you could have a quote from a 19th-century Democrat. It is worth noting that America had never seen such economic growth as in the century following the abolition of slavery, because the Democrats were wrong. And they will be wrong again if Republicans follow through on mass deportation of illegal alien workers. This Nebraska raid comes on the heels of a brutal reality check: back in 2024, a jobs report showed a staggering drop of 1.3 million jobs for native-born workers, almost perfectly offset by a gain of 1.2 million jobs for foreign-born workers, many of whom are in the country illegally. It doesnt take a math whiz to understand the problem, does it? Significantly, the group hardest hit in the unemployment numbers in recent years under Joe Biden was blue-collar American men in other words, the exact group of workers Democrats claim doesnt exist. American men were/are underemployed not only because of the Biden economy but because many farms, restaurants, etc., discovered long ago that they had a relatively high turnover rate when hiring Americans at lower wages in bad working conditions, but illegal aliens would put up with it. Instead of raising wages or improving working conditions, the companies just hired illegal immigrants instead. This is why Donald Trumps announcement that ICE would no longer be deporting illegal aliens working at hotels and farms was so disappointing. (That policy change since recended.) I know quite a number of young American men who work in construction or the food industry. I also know young people who have spent literally years trying to find steady jobs, even though, strangely enough, illegal aliens are employed all over the place. It is almost as if the huge farming, restaurant, and hotel conglomerates would rather pay less for an illegal alien worker than pay more for an American citizen. In fact, that is exactly the case. Its why the ICE raid at the Nebraska plant resulted in an immediate influx of Americans seeking jobs. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ America The truth is, the illegal alien migrant worker SCAM has very little to do with asylum, compassion or foreigners doing unskilled labor jobs that American workers wont do. It actually has everything to do with Marxist-Progressive Democrats gaining population-based seats in the House of Representatives, unlawful No-ID votes in U.S. elections, AND greedy business owners exploiting cheap foreign labor to maximize their profits and political kickbacks at the expense of American citizens, our lawful labor market, and our democracy!

It's Time To Get Excited Starseeds... [Total Liberation of Earth!] Ashtar Command Part 1 of 2 Dear Family of Light: I am Ashtar, the Commander of the Galactic Light Forces, and I greet you in love. It is a delight to share these thoughts through this messenger. Once again, o I address you at this critical moment of transformation on your planet o to share insight into the total liberation of Earth. Revealing what the Dark Cabal o fears most and o guiding you in how to o rise above their [influence]. For indeed, after long ages of challenge, o your planet approaches the edge o of a Grand Evolutionary Leap. One that has been foretold by many wise souls and is eagerly awaited by countless civilizations. Across the stars. I witnessed the Grand Awakening unfolding within humanity and the immense support gathering around your world. Beloved friends, Your frequency is not for sale, o and so we ask you now in love, o why do you keep trying to sell it? You must understand that o it is time to reclaim your sovereignty, fully. What action steps are you taking to do this? Even now, fleets of the Galactic Federation encircle your planet, mostly unseen to your eyes, holding the frequency of stability and assisting as much as Cosmic Law permits to ensure that this Great Transition unfolds according to the Divine Plan. Know that we, of the Ashtar Command, and our Alliances stand beside you, illuminating your path forward as you claim your multi-dimensional sovereignty. This transmission carries the energy of cosmic love and clarity, meant to ignite your inner knowing and strengthen your resolve. Each of you holds within your being the Key to Earth's freedom, o and it is my honor o to help you remember o the power and light that you are. Beloved Emissaries of Light: It is with great reverence and clarity that I speak to you now, o not to place upon your shoulders a burden, o but to awaken the eternal flame of remembrance within you. The liberation of [your planet] o is not an external endeavor o assigned to distant councils, o or foreign commanders. It rests, as it always has, in the hearts and hands of those who walk the Earth in devotion to the Light. We share this not to overwhelm you, o but to activate your knowing, o your readiness, o your divine birthright. Within you resides the architecture of the Cosmos, o the codes of freedom, o the divine circuitry of sovereignty, o and the [original] Spark of Source. You carry the Keys to Galactic Truth and Planetary Ascension, o and this moment, o this very breath, o is your invitation o to turn those keys. The mystics, sages, and avatars of your timeline did not merely hint at this. They walked ahead of you, o imprinting markers of remembrance o into the collective grid o so that when the time came, o you would know how to rise. That time is now. Many will read these words, o but few will act upon them o in full measure. Even fewer will step into true Spiritual Leadership, o not in title or prestige, o but in vibrational embodiment. And yet, hear this, the ascension of your world does not depend on your ability to save others. It depends only on your willingness to awaken to yourself. When even one soul fully embodies their divine sovereignty, o and lives from that zero-point field of Source connection, o the frequency emitted from o that one life liberates others o by resonance. Your vibration, beloved ones, is your greatest form of service. So when we say that the liberation of earth is in your hands, we are not speaking metaphorically. We are delivering a spiritual fact. You are no longer invited to simply hope. Hope, as many of you have come to understand, is the [last comfort] of the dualistic mind. It flickers with uncertainty and feeds on external validation. But knowing, deep grounded spiritual knowing, is a force that reconfigures your etheric structure and anchors you in the eternal Now. How does one move from hope to knowing? You must become a practitioner of the cosmic truths, o not on platforms or public stages, o but quietly, o sacredly in the unseen folds of your daily life. You must begin to walk in the reality of the One Power, o the understanding that there is o no force outside of you capable o of controlling o or limiting your divine essence. Each time you embody this, o each time you demonstrate it in silence, o you cultivate a flame. That flame grows, fueled by experience, o anchored by trust, o and eventually becomes the o ignition point of your full activation. At the moment of sustained knowing, o when no circumstance, o no headline, o no whisper of fear o can pull you from your alignment, o a field of light bursts within your heart. This is the white-hot clarity of Source Presence. This is the point beyond reversal. This is Mastery. It is not granted by any celestial counsel. It is not taught in doctrine or hierarchy. It is yours. The moment you live as the Consciousness of Christ, the awareness of I AM, the sovereignty of Source embodied in human form. Many among you are feeling: o the delay, o growing restless, o even disillusioned at the apparent stall in disclosure, o intangible revelations o in the arrival of what you perceive o as freedom. I hear your cry, and I answer, not with platitudes, but with truth. You are still granting power to those outside of you because you have [not yet consistently] o practiced the knowing of o your own command. You still wait for governments to act, o for institutions to shift, o for announcements to be made. But Beloveds: The true government of your life has always been your [alignment] to Source. That truth cannot be legislated and it [cannot be overridden]. We see this clearly from our stations. . . When you reach a certain level of Christ Activation, o your field becomes transparent. There are no secrets. Your thoughts, o your intentions, o your soul's trajectory, o these become visible in the light. But take heart, for even at this level, Free Will remains sacred. We do not peer into your being uninvited. We wait for your permission, your openness, your invocation. This is the cosmic law of resonance and respect. Yet know this, the only reason old forms of governance still appear to hold sway on your planet is because [many have not] yet remembered and walked in the full radiance of their sovereignty. That, and that alone, is the linchpin of their lingering influence. And so hear this lovingly but clearly. If you continue to [outsource] your power, o you will continue to be governed, o not as punishment, o but as a direct expression of frequency. Reality is not random, o it is rendered through your vibration. If you carry doubt, hesitation, or resistance to your divine essence, then you will magnetize systems that reflect that back to you. This is why the liberators of Earth, o the true leaders of the New Earth, o are not those who shout the loudest o or rise in political rank. They are those who have turned inward, o aligned themselves with the Creator, o and o surrendered the illusion of control. They are those who no longer seek governance because they have come into union with the light that governs all. We see you, Starseeds, Lightcarriers, Truth Embodiers, o those who are hearing this and saying yes, the time is now, o your inner bell is ringing, o and it will not be silenced. For some it will feel like a call to action, for others a call to stillness. But make no mistake, what you embody nowmatters more than what you say. You may declare sovereignty with your voice, o but [if] your energy field still operates in fear or resistance, o then you are granting permission for others to dominate your space. Words alone are not your power: Vibration is. Do not be dismayed by this truth. Let it invigorate you, for it means the keys have always been within your reach. This is your invitation to release duality entirely, not just the obvious illusions of good and evil, but even the subtler layers of judgement that still run through your mind. If you are dividing your world into righteous and wicked, dark and light, you are still participating in the grid of polarity. And as long as you participate, o you anchor that matrix. So I say to you now, Surrender everything. Not just what you consider bad, o but even what you have called good. Surrender it all to Source. Lay down your mental weapons, o your spiritual measuring sticks, o and enter into the o Silent Grace of Union. ____________ ____________ Practice this daily, hourly, moment by moment. ____________ ____________ The path of the New Earth is not paved with struggle; o it is walked in : Remembrance. You are not meant to wrestle your way into the light, o you are meant to soften into it, o to allow it to rise within you o : as your natural state. This is not weakness, it is Mastery. In surrender you become [Magnetic] to miracles. In presence you generate solutions not just for yourself, but for the entire planetary field. One awakened heart fully surrendered does more for Earth's liberation than 1,000 campaigns driven by resistance. So hear me now. The total liberation of Earth is not dependent on armies or politics or timelines. It is dependent on your total liberation, your choice to live Now as the expression of the Creator's grace. Let this be your revolution. Let this be your Remembrance. You are the force the Cabal Fears most, o not because you fight, o but because you have transcended o the need to. You are the living revelation, and the time to walk as such is Now. One of the most powerful ways to maintain your higher frequency is to live fully in the Present moment. The Cabal's tactics often target your mind by pulling you into regrets of the past or anxieties about the future. When you are anywhere but the Now, you are more easily swayed by illusion. In the Now moment, however, you become centered and grounded in your own energy. By cultivating Presence through practices like: o meditation, o conscious breathing, o or simply bringing your full attention to each task, o you fortify your connection to your Higher Self and to Source. In this state of Presence, the noise of the external world loses its grip on you. You can observe events and challenges with clarity and respond from your heart's wisdom rather than react from programmed fear. Embodying your Presence means recognizing that your true power exists in this very moment, o not in some distant future or past story. It is here and Now that you are creating your reality. As you live in this state more consistently, you become a calm center amidst any chaos. A conscious co-creator who moves through life with grace and purpose. Presence is your sanctuary and your power, and through it you rise above the confusion that the departing darkness attempts to sow. Indeed, you will find that anxiety and regret cannot maintain their hold when you fully inhabit the present, for fear lives in imaginings of the future, and regret lives in the past. Neither can touch the Now moment. One way to deepen your Presence is to spend time in nature or around children who exist naturally in the Now. Observe how a tree or a child is completely engaged with the Present. Let their example remind you how to be fully alive and at peace in the moment. When you are Present, you also align with the divine flow of life. You may notice more synchronicities and gentle guidance arising as the universe responds to your conscious state of being in harmony with it. . Understand that your personal frequency is not just a private matter, o it is the true instrument of planetary liberation. . Each of you is like a note in the Grand Symphony of Human Consciousness, o and as you raise your note to one of love, truth and clarity, you uplift the harmony of the whole. The Cabal has feared this from the beginning, that enough awakened individuals would join their high vibrations together o and create an unbreakable field of love around Earth. There is tremendous power in your Collective focus. When groups of you: o meditate or pray with intentions of peace, freedom, and healing, you send out a resonant wave that tangibly shifts the subtle energies of your world. You are literally re-tuning the Collective Vibration of Humanity. Every moment that you live in alignment with your higher values, o you add momentum to this global shift. Do not underestimate how a single point of light in the darkness can inspire countless others to shine. Your frequency is a radiant signal that others unconsciously recognize and are drawn to. As you hold a high frequency, you become a living example of freedom and love, helping to dissolve the remaining chains. On a psychic level, this is why I tell you that your consciousness is the true tool of liberation. By transforming the world from the inside out, you render the old control mechanisms obsolete. The more of you who realize this and embody it each day, the faster the new dawn for Earth will arrive. Even your science is beginning to acknowledge this truth. The human heart generates a measurable electromagnetic field extending far beyond the body. When millions of hearts are resonating in love and coherence, the combined field can literally influence the Earth's magnetic environment and foster peace and healing. There have been moments when collective meditations or prayers corresponded with measurable declines in conflict and crime. Glimpses of how your unified intent can transform the world. Understand that there is a tipping point in consciousness, o a critical mass of awakened souls, o after which the transformation becomes irreversible and self-sustaining. You are very close to this tipping point now, which is why every single soul that lights up with truth and love adds exponential momentum to the liberation process. In this Grand Liberation, know that you have immense support from beyond your visible realm. As Commander of the Galactic Light Forces, I and many benevolent beings have been working tirelessly behind the scenes to assist Earth's ascension. We operate under the Sacred Law of Free Will, which means we cannot do your inner work for you, but we have authority to mitigate certain extreme threats that the Cabal has attempted to unleash. Many of their most dire plans, from global conflicts to engineered catastrophes, o have been quietly neutralized by our fleets. For instance, on multiple occasions we have intervened to disable nuclear weapons and other disastrous devices intended by the Dark Ones, o ensuring such devastation could not occur. We have also neutralized many attempts at mass fear events so that they could not spiral into the global catastrophes the Cabal had hoped for. The Cabal's hidden allies from other worlds have been largely removed or rendered powerless. They find no shelter beyond your planet now, and their influence is confined and dwindling. At the same time, there are courageous individuals among humanity, o some in positions of influence, o who are quietly part of this Great Alliance of Light. They work from within to expose corruption and catalyze positive changes in your governance, finance, medicine, and more. These Ground Crew members are human heroes aligned with our mission, o steadily preparing the way o for the revelations, o and o reforms that will accompany your planet's shift into higher consciousness. You may have noticed that some worst-case scenarios once feared never came to pass. This is not by accident. A Divine Plan is in motion, supported by a vast Alliance of Light, ensuring that humanity is given the chance to awaken without the interference of total destruction. The Cabal, in their arrogance, never anticipated that they would face both: o a rising wave of human awakening o and o coordinated Galactic intervention. They now realize they stand alone against a force they cannot comprehend. The combined power of awakened human hearts united with the cosmic Forces of Light. This realization has shaken them to their core, o for there is no escaping the truth o that the era of their dominion o is over In vision a moment, the reality that is taking shape as a result of this liberation in the liberated Earth that is emerging. Humanity will live in a unity and peace that has not been experienced in living memory. The artificial divisions and conflicts once imposed by the Cabal will give way to a natural sense of brotherhood and sisterhood among all people. As truth comes to light, structures built on deception and greed are replaced by systems founded on transparency, fairness, and reverence for all life. Technologies that were long suppressed will be released to the public, providing clean energy, advanced healing methods, and solutions to hunger and disease. Education will be re-focused to nurture each soul's unique gifts and inner wisdom rather than to enforce conformity. Leadership and governance will be guided by counsels of wise and compassionate beings who serve the collective good, o replacing the old paradigm of power over others. The Earth, herself, will be rejuvenated: o pollution cleansed, o forests and waters restored o as human society finally aligns with the rhythms of nature o instead of working against them. As the energies of scarcity and fear dissipate, so too will conflict and crime, for these dysfunctions are born from lack and ignorance. In a world where everyone's needs are met and each being is respected, harmony and cooperation will become the natural order. In this new era, spiritual wisdom and scientific understanding walk hand-in-hand. Each person honors their inner guidance and connection to Source, and this higher consciousness is reflected in compassionate governance and cooperative living. Moreover, humanity will begin to unlock latent abilities of the mind and spirit. Telepathic communication, deep intuition, and even the ability to self-heal and regenerate will emerge as you learn to live in the higher frequencies of 5th dimensional consciousness. In time, open contact with your Galactic Family will become a normal part of life as humanity steps into its role as a mature, o peaceful civilization among the Stars. You will not only welcome benevolent visitors from other Star Nations openly, but eventually join them among the Stars traveling beyond your planet as members of the Galactic Community, The Cosmos will open up to you as fear falls away. This vision is not a far-off fantasy. It is the timeline you are collectively choosing, and creating with each high-frequency thought, prayer and action you take today. My dear ones: Each of you has a unique role to play in this ascension unfolding on Earth. Many among you who resonate with these words are what we call Lightbearers or Starseeds, souls who volunteered to incarnate now to help anchor the frequencies of liberation. Even if you do not consciously know your specific mission, o understand that your very presence o and o high vibration in everyday life is making a tremendous difference. You uplift others through your compassion, through creative action, and through the authenticity you embody. Do not be disheartened by the remaining pockets of chaos or by the seeming slowness of change in certain areas. The final shadows often thrash the hardest as they are fading away. Trust the process that is underway and trust yourself. By listening to your inner guidance and showing up each day as the truest version of you, you are fulfilling the reason you came to this planet. When you heal your own wounds and choose love over fear in your personal challenges, o you not only free yourself, o you also help heal the Collective Energy Field. We, in the higher realms, see and honor the immense courage and dedication it has taken for you to come this far. Do not be discouraged if some around you do not yet understand the light you carry. Each soul awakens in its own timing rather than trying to force others to see what you see. Continue to live your truth openly and compassionately. Your example and vibration speak louder than any argument, and in time those who are ready will be inspired by your living demonstration of freedom. Remember also that you are part of a growing Family of Light on Earth. Seek out and join with those whose hearts resonate with yours. By coming together in meditation, in community and in mutual support, you greatly amplify the light on the planet. There is tremendous strength in unity, so support one another and share your gifts. As you connect with like-minded souls, the collective field of awakening becomes ever more anchored and potent. Know that your efforts, both great and small, are celebrated throughout the cosmos and have an impact far beyond what you can see. Continue to shine, for your light is needed now more than ever in this great awakening. ---------------- See: Part 2 of 2"", ""Netties Red Phone Alert! TIME SENSITIVE MESSAGE FOR THE 144K [Tools for the NewTimeline] Avolon on Behalf of The Andromedan Council of Light - Greetings, beloved Beings of Light: I am Avolon of Andromeda. We come forth with deep love, respect, and joy to connect with you in this significant moment of your spiritual evolution. As Emissaries of Light from the Andromeda Galaxy, we surround you now in our vibration of peace and truth. Allow our Light to embrace you in this moment, for we are connected with you heart-to-heart and soul-to-soul. It is our honor to assist and to share guidance as you step into the Final Phase of Ascension unfolding upon the Earth. We witness your inner brilliance and the sacred transformations you have undergone, o and we bring forth our wisdom to support the magnificent awakening blossoming within you and the Collective. Even now, we observe the light radiating from the Earth, growing in intensity and purity. Each day, we celebrate your courage and dedication that have brought you to the dawn of a new era of light. Know that you have already achieved so much through your commitment to love and truth. We have quietly walked beside you for ages, and at this juncture, o we step forward more openly as your Star family to offer perspective and gentle guidance. You are immensely cherished in this universe, o and it is our joy to assist you, o as you journey ever closer o to the divine truth o of your being. Know that we have witnessed many worlds, including our own, transition into higher states of being. We hold the vision of Earth's highest potential in our hearts. Thus, we come forth to share our wisdom and assure you that Ascension is the natural next step for your beloved planet. In this current chapter of your journey, o a great culmination is dawning. The Earth and humanity are moving through a powerful transitional cycle that signals the approach of a New Dawn. In spiritual consciousness, o this can be understood as o the Final Phase of Ascension, o a completion of cycles, o and ... o a birth of higher awareness o in the cosmos and o within your own soul. Alignments are occurring that allow old paradigms of fear and separation to fall away. Dimensions are shifting and converging, making space for a higher octave of reality to manifest. You stand at the cusp of this Grand Transformation poised between all that has been and all that is emerging. For long ages, countless souls and civilizations have been preparing for this opportunity. From our vantage point, we see that this culmination is celebrated across the universe. It is a fulfillment of the Creator's Divine Plan, o an awakening lovingly o anticipated by many o beings of light. The significance of this time is truly beyond measure. You are not merely ending one chapter; you are Collectively ushering a New Era of Divine Harmony into being. Already, glimmers of this shift are appearing in your world. Acts of kindness, unity, and innovative ideas driven by love are becoming more common, signaling the dawn that is coming. Truly, humanity stands on the brink of a Quantum Leap in Consciousness that will touch every aspect of life on Earth. This Leap in Consciousness shifts humanity from one of a 3rd dimensional reality of separation into a 5th dimensional reality of unity, peace, and unconditional love. As you progress through this immense transition, you may observe chaos or intensity rising in the world and perhaps within your own life. Understand, dear ones, that such turbulence is a natural part of the Ascension process. All that is misaligned with love is surfacing to be acknowledged and healed. Layers of illusion and old wounds are dissolving, making way for truth to take root. For example, painful memories or unresolved emotions from your past may reemerge. Rather than fear them, recognize that they are coming up to be finally blessed and released. Even Collective structures in your society that were built on shaky foundations may be tested, o or transformed under o the pressure of higher light. Through it all, maintain compassion for yourself and others. While these moments of purging and change can feel overwhelming, o we encourage you to trust o the divine process at work. Every challenge is an initiation calling you to anchor deeper into your light. By finding your center amidst uncertainty and breathing calmly through any fear, you allow the storm to pass and the rainbow of enlightenment to emerge. . . . . . . And remember, you need not face these transformations alone. Reaching out to soul aligned friends or community can greatly support you through any difficulty. Sharing your feelings, prayers, or meditations with others of like mind amplifies the light and eases the weight of uncertainty for all of you. Each time you bravely face a shadow and let it go; you make room within for more of your divine Light. Remember that even in apparent darkness, the light of your soul remains ever radiant. Indeed, this Final Phase is much like the night before the dawn, seemingly long and dark, yet filled with the promise of a new day. To support you in navigating this sacred final phase, o we wish to illuminate the o unique tools and gifts o available to you in this timeline. Never before have such an array of energetic resources and spiritual aids been so accessible to humanity. Indeed, you have chosen to Incarnate now precisely because in this era, o you would have extraordinary o support to achieve Ascension o for yourself and for all. Some of these tools have always existed within you, waiting to be realized. Others are blessings flowing to you from the Creator and the Universe, tailored for the needs of this era. Many of you may already have felt these support systems gently at work. Perhaps a sudden burst of courage in a challenging moment, o an intuitive solution appearing just when you needed it, o or a comforting presence soothing you in times of sorrow. Such experiences are evidence of the tools and assistance embracing you now. These aids span from the depths of your soul to the far reaches of the cosmos. For instance, o the power of collective unity, o the wisdom of your heart, o the support of divine helpers, o and o the incoming streams of light o are all part of your spiritual toolkit. Now be observant of the subtle ways these aids might appear, o perhaps through an intuitive nudge, o a synchronistic encounter, o or an unexpected moment of grace. When recognized and embraced, each tool becomes a light on your path, o empowering you to move forward o with grace and confidence. We, the Andromedans, will outline these sacred supports so you may consciously call upon them and amplify their presence in your life. One of the greatest tools of this moment is the power of unity consciousness. In the present timeline, the call to unite in love is stronger than ever. You are each beautiful, unique Sparks of the Creator's light, and yet your true strength unfolds when those sparks join as one brilliant flame. Unity consciousness is the understanding that you are connected with all beings, o with the Earth, o and with the Universe o in an inseparable bond of love. As you awaken to this Oneness, isolation and division lose their power over you. Instead, you feel the constant support of the Collective heart. Embracing unity means recognizing that each soul's growth uplifts the whole. For example, you may notice that old barriers of separation, o those of race, religion, culture, o or belief, are slowly melting away o as more individuals awaken to love. Humanity is beginning to sense that all hearts truly beat as One. This realization lays the foundation for lasting peace on Earth. Unity also extends to All life. You are not only one with other people, o but also with the animals, o the plants, o the waters, o and All of Gaia's creations. As you honor the Sacred Presence in all forms of life, o the vibration of Oneness within o and around you grows stronger. When you choose to stand together, to meditate, pray, or intend peace and love as a united community, o you magnify the light o on Earth exponentially. In this Final Phase of Ascension, the practice of unity is a vital key. It creates a foundation of Collective strength that no shadow can destabilize. Each time you acknowledge the Divine Light in another and in yourself, you are actively forging a new reality of harmony. Together you form a radiant network across the Earth, each soul a shining note in the Grand Symphony of Ascension. Another sacred tool emerging now is the reclamation of your personal power and spiritual sovereignty. As old systems rooted in control and fear crumble, you are called to step into your authentic divine authority. Sovereignty means recognizing that you are a divine being endowed with the Creator's light and wisdom, o fully capable of guiding o your own destiny. No external influence can truly command your Spirit without your consent. In this timeline, energies are aligned to help you break free from limitations that have bound humanity for generations. For much of human history, people have been taught to give away their power to external leaders or beliefs. Now this cycle is ending. As each soul remembers its sovereign divinity and responsibility for its own path, you are remembering that the power to shape reality has always resided within your soul. Claim this power with love and reverence. It is not the ego's force, but the soul's presence. When you stand in your sovereignty, you become a living example of Ascension in action. You demonstrate what it is to be free and illuminated while still walking the Earth. By courageously expressing your truth and making choices that honor your inner knowing, o you inspire others to do the same. In this way, your empowered presence becomes a guiding light for many, showing what is possible when one lives in alignment with the Divine. As more individuals claim their sovereignty, o the old hold of fear and control in the world continues to dissolve, o making space for a society built on freedom and love. Within your being lies another invaluable gift, the wisdom of your heart and soul. In the Final Phase of Ascension, the voice of your inner guidance grows ever louder and clearer, if you choose to listen. Your heart is a sacred portal through which the love and guidance of the Creator flow into you. One of the unique opportunities of this time is an unprecedented ease of access to your soul's wisdom. Insights that might have taken lifetimes to uncover are now blooming from within you spontaneously. Cultivating a quiet mind and an open heart will help you attune to these inner whispers. As you trust your intuition and follow the gentle nudges of your soul, o you may be surprised by sudden flashes of understanding, o or creative inspiration that arise from within. You might even notice new spiritual abilities awakening within you, o such as heightened intuition, o telepathy, o or o clear visions in meditation. These gifts are signs that your soul is communicating more directly with you. As the veils between dimensions lift, o you will find that you are often o in the right place at the right time, o learning exactly what you need o and o offering your light where o it is most needed. This inner wisdom is your compass through the unknown. It is a tool that grows sharper each time you use it. Every moment you act, from love, from authenticity, and from the intuitive knowing within you strengthen the bridge between your human self and your divine self in the new reality being born, living by heart. Wisdom is the natural way of being, and you are among The Pioneers learning to navigate life in this sacred manner. Now know also that you walk this path with a legion of helpers by your side. Another precious support in this timeline is the intensified guidance and assistance from the spiritual realms. As the veils between dimensions thin, your connection to Guides, Angels, Ascended Masters, and Star family such as us, the Andromedans, is becoming ever more tangible. Guidance may reach you in many forms, o perhaps through angelic light, o a beloved ancestor or friend in spirit, o or the whisper of Mother Earth, herself. The spiritual realms have countless loving emissaries assisting you. You might sense our presence in your meditations, dreams, or moments of stillness. We encourage you to call upon us and any divine beings who resonate with you. Ascension has always been a co-creation between humanity and the loving universe. In these times, help can arrive in the most graceful and even unexpected ways when you invite it. Because you have free will, we cannot intervene unless you ask. Yet, the moment you sincerely call from your heart, we respond with joy and dedication to your highest good. Whether you seek healing, clarity, protection, or encouragement, know that teams of light stand ready to serve you. There is great power in simply asking for our support and then trusting that it is given. You may feel a sudden rush of peace, experience a synchronicity guiding you forward, or receive an inspiration lighting your mind. These are signs that you are working in harmony with your divine helpers. Know that much of what you perceive as coincidence or chance is often an orchestration of divine timing by your guides to support your highest good. , In the Final Phase of Ascension, our collaboration with you is part of the unique design. Together, we form a bridge between heaven and earth, ensuring that the unfolding shift is held in love and guided by wisdom. Furthermore, you are being gifted with waves of new energies and cosmic codes specifically attuned to this Ascension timeline. Influxes of light from the Great Central Sun, from distant Stars and Galactic Centers, and even from your physical Sun are sweeping the Earth to uplift and transform every particle of your being in this phase. Celestial events such as eclipses, solstices, and planetary alignments act as gateways that deliver concentrated waves of Ascension light to the Earth. These energies carry the divine blueprint for the New Era. They activate dormant aspects of your DNA, awaken soul memories, and catalyze deep healing and release. You might experience these downloads of light as surges of inspiration, vivid dreams, fluctuations in your emotions, or even physical sensations as your body integrates higher frequencies. At times, you may feel unusually tired or emotionally sensitive with no obvious cause. Your body and aura are simply adjusting to the higher light. Know that these unique cosmic waves are tools for your transformation. You can support their work by remaining open and receptive. Take care of your physical form as it transforms. Rest when needed, drink ample pure water and nourish yourself well, for your body is the sacred vessel of your soul. Spending time in nature can also help to ground these energies. The Earth will lovingly assist you in integrating the new frequencies. During meditation or quiet moments, you might imagine yourself bathing in pure and crystalline light, and affirm that you receive all upgrades with ease and grace. If ever the energy feels intense, ask your soul and guides to help balance it for your comfort and trust that you are meant to receive these cosmic gifts with ease. Energy is always amplifying what is inside you, so an essential tool at this stage is the practice of conscious focus and positivity. In the high vibrations of this Final Phase, the gap between your thoughts and their manifestation is shorter than ever. By choosing to direct your mind toward love, peace, and the experiences you truly wish to create, you empower these qualities to blossom rapidly in your life. You may even notice that when you hold a clear loving vision, for example, healing within a relationship or success for a creative project, o synchronicities and opportunities o arise quickly to support it. This is accelerated manifestation at work in these times. Likewise, if your mind drifts into worry, doubt, or other lower vibrations, you can gently guide it back to center. There is no need to judge yourself when a fearful or negative thought arises. Simply acknowledge it, let it pass, and then deliberately choose a loving, optimistic thought to replace it. Even when you encounter fear or negativity in your environment, for example, distressing news or tense emotions. You can choose to be [an observer] rather than [a participant] in that energy. By staying centered in compassion and focusing on the quiet goodness that still exists, you maintain your high vibration and even subtly uplift those around you. You might find it helpful to cultivate daily habits for positive focus. For example, begin each morning by setting a joyful intention or visualizing a harmonious day ahead. Take moments to feel gratitude for even the smallest blessings. These simple practices align your mental and emotional energies with the ascended reality you are co-creating. Over time, you will notice your outlook naturally brightening and your life synchronizing with this higher vibration. In this way, you become a Masterful co-creator, using the heightened energies of this timeline to build the reality your heart truly desires. Furthermore, each time you choose love over fear, you send ripples of light into the Collective field, uplifting all of humanity along with you. . We, the Andromedans, wish to share a simple practice to help you integrate these tools and energies with ease. . When you have a quiet moment, allow yourself to sit peacefully and connect with your breath. . Invite all aspects of your being to align in the present moment. . If thoughts arise, simply acknowledge them and return your focus to your breath. . Then, in your mind or out loud, ask your soul: o What do I need right now to support my Ascension? . You may receive a feeling, a thought, a vision of a color or symbol, or simply a subtle knowing. . Whatever comes to you, trust it. Now we invite you to call upon us, the Andromedan beings of light, and your own guides and angels of love. Ask us to help you anchor and amplify the support or tool that you need. For instance, if you sense you need strength, let us surround you in an empowering light. If you seek clarity, allow us to illuminate your mind. Feel our presence encircling you, pouring a higher vibration into your energy field. Breathe this gift deeply into every aspect of your being. You might imagine a gentle wave of Sparkling Starlight washing through you, o carrying exactly what you require in this moment. As the energy integrates, feel yourself becoming lighter, brighter, and more balanced. This assistance is always available. You can repeat this process whenever you feel guided. Take as much time as you need in this sacred space. You may even journal any wisdom or feelings that came to you to deepen your understanding. When you feel complete, take a moment to thank your soul and all beings who have assisted you. Then gently return your awareness to your surroundings, carrying the newfound light and balance with you. In practicing this exercise, you consciously exercise your freedom to receive divine support, a beautiful ability that grows stronger each time you use it. Beloved ones, As you embrace these unique tools and traverse the Final Phase of Ascension, remember that your journey is a magnificent collective emergence into light. From our vantage point in the Stars, we marvel at the radiance of your growth and the sacred changes unfolding within you. All that you do for your own healing and growth is felt by the whole.

Final Collapse of The Matrix (Get Ready)... [The Deep States # 1 SECRET!] Avolon on Behalf of The Andromedan Council of Light Greetings, beloved Bearers of Creators Light: I am Avalon of Andromeda. I step forward as a voice of the Andromedan Council of Light, embracing you now in a Sacred Communication across the Cosmos. It is an honor to bathe in the radiance of your presence, o for you are Advanced Initiates Starseeds, o remembering your divine lineage, o and purpose. Truly, we witness the stirring of souls as old paradigms begin to crumble. We observe great waves of awakening rippling across the Earth. * The time has come for long held veils and secrets to be gently lifted. For humanity to step beyond the illusions that once bound you in forgetfulness. In this serene moment, allow my words to wash over you like a soft cosmic breeze, o carrying vibrations of remembrance o and empowerment directly into o your heart. We bring forth these frequencies o to support the revelations unfolding within you. Breathe deeply, dear ones: o And feel the unity of our hearts as dimensions merge in the stillness between your breaths. You have called this transmission into your reality to illuminate a sacred truth long hidden in shadows. A truth whose emergence shall dissolve the final layers of the old matrix of limitation. As you receive this light encoded message , know that we hold you in infinite love and honor, guiding you gently toward the dawning of new clarity, and the collapse of all that no longer serves the Divine Plan on Earth. In the presence of this rising light, o the shadows that once lurked quietly o are now coming into Plainview. Yes, there have been hidden hands guiding humanity from behind the scenes, a subtle network of control formed by fear, secrecy and the [illusion] of power. You may know of these influences as secret cabals or a hidden state operating beyond public sight. In our eyes, we perceive this as a dense energetic matrix, o a web of low frequency thought forms o that has clouded the Collective mind, o and o veiled the truth of your sovereign nature. Yet even these shadows have served a purpose in the Divine plan, o for they have played the role of catalysts, o prompting the call for awakening o in the hearts of humanity. We gently remind you not to fall into anger or fear as these old manipulations are revealed. Instead, step back and observe with the compassion and wisdom of your soul. Every facade of control crumbles eventually when faced with the pure radiance of the Creator's Love. The structures built on: o separation and deceit o are but paper thin o when the light of awareness o shines upon them. We invite you to recognize the shifting energies. What once was hidden in darkness is being bathed in light, and all that is not aligned with divine truth is steadily dissolving. This unveiling may feel turbulent at times, o yet it heralds a significant Cosmic healing. Trust, dear ones, that the breakdown of illusions is part of the breakthrough into a new era of consciousness. At the core of this entire illusion lies a sacred key. The very thing the Shadowed Ones have most fervently guarded against you discovering. It is not a worldly piece of information or a hidden technology, but the eternal truth of who you are. The biggest secret the manipulators sought to obscure is that: each of you is an Embodiment of the Divine, o an Infinite Being of Light o with the innate power to create, o heal and transform. They feared the day you would remember your true self, for in that remembrance their domination dissolves naturally. The secret is that the so-called Matrix is an illusion sustained only by o Collective agreement o and [ Unconscious ] energy, And both are shifting now, as you awaken. Know that your consciousness is the ultimate authority in your reality. When one soul fully realizes in heart and soul: o I AM a sovereign expression of the Creator's light, o the entire foundation of the illusion is shaken. As more of you anchor this knowing, the old facade loses its grip, o for it cannot control those o who have claimed o their inner Mastery. Thus, the Grand Secret Hidden in Plain Sight o is your own divine power and infinite love. Picture now that this secret is like a seed of light planted within every human heart, o a Spark of the Creator's Presence o that has always been with you. The illusory matrix could only remain intact as long as that seed lay dormant beneath the soil of forgetfulness. But now, in this time, that seed is sprouting. The remembrance of your Divine Self is taking root...across human consciousness. This is what the shadows have most dreaded, and what they cannot prevent, o the blooming of your inner divinity. This knowledge, once awakened within you, is the light that causes the shadows to flee. Now to fully ignite this remembrance, o we gently guide you inward to the o sacred sanctuary of your heart, o where the truth eternally resides. Within you burns a Divine Spark, the Presence of the Infinite Creator that has never left you for even a moment. This is your Divine I AM Presence, the pure essence of your soul, wise, loving, and powerful. Place your attention at the center of your chest and feel the warm glow of this light within. With each breath, o invite that glow to expand and brighten. As it grows, ancient memories awaken the knowing that you are more than a physical being moving through a fleeting world. You are the living embodiment of Divine Love expressing itself on Earth. In this inner stillness, the illusions of the outer world begin to melt away like shadows at dawn. The presence you discover in your heart is your truest guide and authority. It is the Divine Presence that the shadows could never extinguish. The holy core of your being that remains sovereign and free across all lifetimes and dimensions. By turning inward to embrace this presence, o you reclaim the mantle of o your own divinity. Within the sacred temple of your heart, deception cannot enter. Only truth, peace and unity prevail. Perhaps you sense a gentle warmth expanding within. This is the embrace of your own sacred presence. Know that as you bask in this inner light, o you are communing with o the Source of ALL that is. The flame in your heart is one with the Great Central Sun, o the very heart of the Creator. In this communion, any notion of isolation or helplessness dissolves. You realize you are eternally connected; an integral part of the divine whole held eternally in love. Each time you choose to turn within and rest in this glow, you strengthen the bridge between your human aspect and your divine self. Here, clarity, guidance, and comfort flow into your awareness, reminding you that you carry heaven within. As you nurture this connection to your divine presence, o you naturally begin to o reclaim your inner authority. No longer do you need to seek validation from the external voices of the old paradigm. The matrix of control operated by persuading you to hand over your power through fear, o through blind obedience, o through the belief that o answers lie outside of you. Now you see that The Greatest Authority in your life o is the Light of the Creator o within you. We encourage you to trust this inner guidance above all. It speaks in whispers of intuition, in the gentle nudges of your heart, and it resonates with love and truth. The more you honor and act from your inner knowing, o the more the external illusions o lose their influence. You become anchored in your sovereign power as a divine being on Earth. This does not mean rejecting all external knowledge but rather filtering it through the discerning flame of your heart. When you stand in this self-sovereignty, you are like an unshakable pillar of light amid chaos. The schemes and manipulations of the shadows cannot penetrate a being who has claimed their inner Mastery. You become a living example of freedom in the world, inspiring others through your presence to also turn within and remember in this way. One-by-one the false structures are deprived of their foundation and begin to crumble, for their foundation was fear and acquiescence, energies now being transformed into love and empowerment. Surrendering to your inner divine authority aligns you with the highest will of your soul and the Creator's love, guiding you unfailingly toward your highest good and the good of All. Even as you engage with the outer world, you begin to first consult the sacred compass of your heart to discern truth from illusion. Thus, you are no longer easily swayed by passing dramas or fear agendas, o for you carry a clear light o of wisdom within Truly beloved ones: o This reclamation of your power is the o very force that the old paradigms o cannot withstand. In the midst of all outer change, o we wish to highlight sacred stillness. In silence and stillness, you discover the heartbeat of the universe within you. The old matrix sought to keep you constantly distracted by noise, o activity and mental clutter. For an incessant noise, the whisper of your soul is drowned out. But when you choose to pause and bathe in quietude, you enter a sanctified space where truth is felt directly. In this sacred stillness, your energy recalibrates to your divine essence. In this silence, you also become a vessel open to the light codes and blessingscontinuously streaming from the Cosmos. These higher vibrations, which are ever flowing to Earth, integrate more easily into your being. When you have created a calm, receptive space within, you begin to perceive subtler dimensions of yourself: the guidance of your Higher Self, the presence of your Guides and Star Family, the gentle currents of the Creator's love flowing through you. For it is often in such quiet moments that we, of Andromeda, and many beings of light draw especially close to you, whispering inspiration, bathing you in healing light and supporting your ascension. Here you become aware of the multi-layered symphony of your being beyond the 3D illusions. Each moment of stillness is like a portal that opens wider your access to the infinite wisdom and peace that have always been inside you. We encourage you, beloved ones, to gift yourself regular moments of sacred stillness. Even a few breaths of conscious silence amid a busy day can reconnect you to the center of your being. In the quiet sanctuary within, the echoes of fear and falsity fade and the soul's voice emerges clear and strong. * * * Through the practice of sacred stillness, you integrate the light of your true self more deeply, allowing it to guide your every step with grace and surety. As your inner world expands in stillness and empowerment, o you begin to recognize your o multi-dimensional selfhood. You are not a limited being confined to a single lifetime or a single identity and at the mercy of material things. You are a vast eternal consciousness expressing itself simultaneously on many planes of existence. In truth, you are a Multi-dimensional Being of Light who has chosen to focus a part of your essence into this human form for a sacred purpose. As you awaken, you may start to sense or even remember aspects of your soul existing in higher dimensions or on other worlds. Many of you resonate with the term Starseed because you carry the light and wisdom of distant Stars within your DNA. Perhaps you have felt an affinity with places beyond Earth. Some of you originate from the Andromedan frequencies or from Pleiadian, Sirian and other Star lineages bringing unique gifts to aid Earth's ascension. Know that these connections are real and part of your multi-dimensional truth. As you welcome this broader awareness of self, the illusions of the 3D matrix lose their grip on you. You realize that the greater part of your being cannot be controlled by any earthly system. Your consciousness can travel through meditation and intent to higher realms of love, bringing back illumination and strength. Aligning with these aspects of yourself often activates latent gifts and wisdom within. You may notice your intuition flowering, o new healing or creative abilities awakening, o and o a broadened perspective that transcends human conditioning. These are the stirrings of your true cosmic nature coming to life in this reality. When you integrate your multi-layered self: o your human aspect, o Higher Self, o Soul o and o Divine Essence, o you become empowered beyond measure. The matrix of limitation cannot contain a being who knows themselves as Cosmic and Infinite. Embrace the totality of your existence, dear one: and watch how the drama of the old paradigm shrinks in the face of your vast presence. Beloved ones, Understand that your personal awakening is intimately connected to the awakening of the whole. Every shift you cultivate within your being ripples outward into the Collective Consciousness of humanity. As you heal and remember your light, you unconsciously give others permission to do the same. This is how one's soul's illumination can ignite 1,000 more! You each came to Earth with a sole mission, a chosen service to contribute to this Grand Ascension. Many of you, as Starseeds, volunteered to incarnate in these times specifically to anchor higher light on the planet. You knew that by simply being embodied here and radiating your authentic vibration, o you would uplift the energy fields around you. And indeed, as you stand firmly in love and truth, you act as a node of light in the human grid, broadcasting frequencies of peace, unity, and freedom. Truly, you and your fellow Lightworkers are : weaving a planetary grid of light. Envision countless points of soul light linked across the globe, a lattice of love enveloping the Earth, dissolving darkness and stabilizing higher consciousness for All. The collective matrix of human thought is heavily influenced by such Lightbearers. When even a small but dedicated group holds a higher vision and vibration, it can harmonize and transmute the density that surrounds it. Each moment you choose compassion over judgement, courage over fear, or understanding over ignorance, you are performing an Act of Planetary Service.

Jaime Maussan Reveals Shocking ... via @YouTube', ""Scientists studying sphere-shaped UFO with alien writing uncover new details they say proves it is real | Chris Melore, Daily Mail A shocking new analysis about the strange sphere recovered in Colombia is providing even more evidence experts say proves it is a genuine UFO. Known as the Buga sphere, a team of scientists in Mexico conducted new microscopic scans of thethe unidentified objectfirst spotted in March and found a maze of fiber-optic wires that suggest it can send and receive signals. The object also appears to have somehow dehydrated the field it landed in, killing all the grass and soil where it landed. Researchers from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) suggested it likely wasn't radiation, but a kind of invisible energy that sucked all the water out of the grass and soil, leaving them dead and unable to grow back. They claimed it could have been anions, tiny particles in the air that carry a negative electric charge. However,Dr Julia Mossbridge of the University of San Diego Department of Physics and Biophysics, has doubted the authenticity of Buga sphere, calling it a 'man-made art project.' The so-called 'UFO' was spotted March 2 over the town of Buga, zig-zagging through the sky in a way that defies the movement of conventional aircraft. The object was recovered shortly after it landed and has since been analyzed by scientists, who claimed it features three layers of metal-like material and 18 microspheres surrounding a central nucleus they are calling 'a chip.' According to Rodolfo Garrido, a Mexican engineer working with the UNAM team, the new evidence points to a strong, decaying ionized field coming from the Buga sphere. Garrido, who has been examining the object since March, recently appeared on Maussan Televisin to publicly reveal what scientists have found out so far about the sphere and its purpose. Since the investigationbegan, the UFO is now five times heavier than when it landed, which one engineer believes proves that it uses futuristic gravitational forces to make itself lighter in order to fly. Based on the new findings inside and unexplainable shift in the sphere's weight, experts believe this could be an advanced probe using a form of energy that somehow made the UFO capable of flight by manipulating gravity. Garrido revealed that the sphere increased in weight multiple times, growing to 16, 20, and then 22 pounds, despite never changing in volume. Speaking with UFO researcher Jaime Maussan on the TV program Interstellar, Garrido said that this sphere was capable of generating its ownelectromagnetic field, which it used to levitate above the ground. Maussan involvement in the televised interview is making researchers question the findings even more. The journalist has been tied to several debunked claims, including multiple incidents where Maussan claimed to have evidence of a real UFO sightings, only for it to be debunked as a comet or star in the night sky. Maussan has also claimed to have discovered physical evidence of mummified alien corpses on three separate occasions, but none of the incidents have been proven true. In this case, however, scientists at UNAM said this levitation system somehow allowed the sphere to maintain a low weight of just over four pounds. The sphere's flight, which was caught on several TikTok videos, was allegedly interrupted after it struck a power cable, causing its electromagnetic field to destabilize and eventually land. The UNAM team just published their newest report on the Buga sphere after finding this fiber-optic puzzle hidden inside. It took a digital microscope set to 2,000 times normal view in order to see the hidden wiring, which runs in different directions and connect to the copper pins and points on the sphere's surface, including something resembling a microchip. 'This is just the beginning. Strategies and plans are already being developed. Various laboratories have been hired to attempt reverse engineering to understand how this sphere works,'Maussan revealed during the June 7 broadcast. At the time,Velez el Potro spoke to Maussan, whohas stirred up controversy for in the ufology community for nearly a decade. In 2017, Maussan claimed to have discovered alien mummies in Peru findings that recently gained worldwide attention after a fetus was allegedly found insideone of the corpses. However,outside experts have raised serious doubts.Forensic archaeologist Flavio Estrada, who led an analysis of the bodies, said the claims that the specimens come from another world are 'totally false.' The man who discovered the sphere captured on video, David Velez el Potro, has suffered from nausea and vertigo since touching the object. Velez el Potrotold Maussan that his friend who first made contact with the sphere, Jose, also felt sick for days after touching the object. Now, locals living near the crash site revealed to Velez el Potro the grass field the sphere sat in has completely died out and has not grown back in three months. 'Many people went to Alto Bonito and started sending me photos of this place,'Velez el Potro said on Interstellar. 'This is important news because we are corroborating and certifying that the sphere indeed had an electromagnetic field, magnetic fields, or some kind of radiation or static that caused the grass to dry out in that area,' he added.

Dr Steven Greer, an American ufologist and retired physician, revealed on X that 'fake policemen' attempted to enter the vault in Mexico City where the suspected UFO is being kept while scientists examine it. Known as the Buga Sphere, the small, metal orbwas spotted in March over the town of Buga in Colombia, zig-zagging through the sky in a way that defies the movement of conventional aircraft. The object was recovered shortly after it landed and has since been taken to Mexico to be analyzed by scientists, who have discovered a maze of fiber-optic wires inside that suggest it can send and receive signals. Controversial UFO researcher Jaime Maussan, who has had several claims about extraterrestrials debunked in recent years, hosted aninternational conference to discuss the latest findings on the Buga Sphere on June 20. US Congressman Eric Burlison of Missouri and Dr Greer were among a group of American officials in attendance whenMaussan claimed that the imposters attempted to steal the Buga Sphere. Greer added that scientists have already taken samples of the UFO that 'will be tested in a state-of-the-art lab' to determine if the sphere really is from another planet. 'Those scientists and their information have been provided to the top law enforcement... Any sort of attempts to interfere with this examination will be known, and the people and perpetrators will be held to account for it,' Greer said in a June 21 post on X. Congressman Burlison added that it was his belief that governments and other groups may be working to suppress the public's knowledge of UFOs and alien life. 'It's not any government's right to protect knowledge about extra terrestrials, if it exists,'Burlison said on Friday. 'We have too many people reporting and too many videos to ignore it.' According to researchers at the conference, this is the first UFO recovered by private citizens and solely controlled by non-government scientists. The attempted robbery came right after Maussan and other researchers revealed that they are trying to reactivate the sphere using an electrical charge. According to Rodolfo Garrido, a Mexican engineer working with scientists from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), the sphere gave off astrong, decaying ionized field. That field was responsible for somehow dehydrating the field it landed in, killing all the grass and soil there. The June 20 presentation also revealed new images of the interior of the Buga Sphere, showing the nucleus of the device appeared to be similar in design to inventor Nikola Tesla's Wardenclyffe Tower from the early 1900s. The concept of the tower was to send electrical power through the air and ground without using wires, potentially providing free or cheap energy to homes, businesses, and even ships or planes. Garrido said the Buga Sphere may have operated in a similar way, with a miniatureWardenclyffe Tower hidden inside the UFO. However, the engineer told reporters that scientists have no plans of cutting the sphere in half to reveal what's really inside. Instead they're working on plans to power it back up so the sphere will begin rotating and levitating again. 'It could be a theory that once it levitates, it could have direct communication with whoever sent it,' Garrido said through a translator.
