And, they control the major media, which is why we know nothing about democracy, as we know it, is less than 250 years old. For most of history, except for this brief period, the world has been ruled by powerful elites who wielded absolute power over their societies, controlled the wealth and resources of their known world, and dominated their people by force. The New World Order cabal plans to restore this model of totalitarian rule on a global endgame will be a one-world government presiding over the earth for the benefit of global oligarchs and their superclass functionaries, leaving the mass of humanity as serfs, to serve the elite, while suffering impoverishment and immiseration. The plan includes scientifically engineered global population reduction (viruses/vaccines/genetically-modified food), cutting the world's population to less than one billion, leaving the earth's resources for the exclusive use of this global conspiracy to impose a global totalitarian society has been shrouded in almost total secrecy. To begin to understand the elite's endgame, we must learn about the plan's origins and development, and about the individuals, organizations, and institutions that fund, control, and benefit from it."", 'The New World Order is a very competitive World Order. And I think the new Trump Administration will underpin this Hopefully, this New World Order is not the jungle growing back, Borge Brende, President of the World Economic Forum, said at a recent press World Economic Forums annual meeting for 2025 is taking place from 20 to 24 January in, as usual, Davos-Klosters, Switzerland. The theme of this years meeting is Collaboration for the Intelligent Age and will focus on various topics, including AI transformation, resilience and geopolitics, energy transition, womens health, and 21st-century of the Globalists annual shindig, on 7 January, World Economic Forum President Brge Brende and McKinsey Global Managing Partner Bob Sternfels held a press briefing to unveil the second edition of the Global Cooperation Barometer. Its a tool to measure and guide collaboration across trade, technology, climate, health, and we have little to no interest in the WEF-McKinsey collaboration on a tool to measure and guide the world on how to collaborate, Brende espoused his view about the incoming New World Order.The Barometer, with the 41 different indicators, gives us a feel of where global cooperation stands today, Brende said. He blabbed on:The three decades of increased cooperation that we saw after the Cold War has definitely ended. We are between World Orders. We had one World Order post the Cold War that enhanced and incentivised cooperation.And no, we dont really know what the New World Order is about but cooperation also has to play a role in that New World Order.But currently between orders, and we know that from history too, there is disorder. So, one has to really struggle to find ways of cooperating when countries are also competing competing for increased influence in a new world.And, hopefully, this New World Order is not the jungle growing back but there is ways, also, to collaborate in a very competitive world. One can look at the situation like a glass half empty or a glass half full.Later, at around timestamp 30:00, he gave a little more information about what was causing their concern about the New World Order, which hopefully is not the jungle growing back.', ""The New World Order Is Here, And America Isn't Part Of It #PayAttentionThe New World Order Is Here, A...""]","0, world, new, order, world order",1071

The founder of SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink and other ambitious projects has become a symbol of the technological revolution. His ideas on creating a sustainable future for humanity, space exploration and the development of artificial intelligence have received worldwide recognition. However, like any major figure, Musk has become the subject of various conspiracy theories that span his personal life, business projects and influence on world of the most popular theories is that Musk is hiding the true goals of his projects, especially in the field of space. It is said that SpaceX is not just developing rocket technology for commercial launches, but is also working on creating technologies for the colonization of Mars to prepare humanity for a possible apocalypse on Earth. Many proponents of this theory suggest that Musk has access to secret information that confirms the inevitability of a global catastrophe, and that his mission is to create a Plan B for human the question of how much Musk really hides his real motives remains open. He himself claims that his ambitions are related to the desire to help humanity, and not to the creation of some kind of global conspiracy. But despite these statements, his actions sometimes arouse suspicion among the of the factors fueling conspiracy theories is also his relationship with government agencies. Musk actively cooperates with NASA, the US government, and also negotiates with other world powers on space research issues. Some critics believe that Musk actually works for the government, and his projects serve not only commercial purposes, but also the strategic interests of states, which adds even more secrecy to his addition, one cannot fail to mention his ideas in the field of artificial intelligence and neurotechnology, which cause no less controversy. In particular, the Neuralink project, which aims to connect the human brain with a computer, excites the imagination of many. Some believe that Musk is seeking to create technology that will allow him to control human consciousness, which means he has hidden plans to manipulate equally important element of the conspiracy theory is Musks personal life. Some argue that his marriages, divorces and relationships with high-profile figures are part of an elaborate strategy to create an image of an ""inspiring genius"" to divert attention from his real any case, no matter how plausible these theories are, Musk continues to be a controversial figure. For some, he is a brilliant innovator and a hero who can change the world. For others, he is a mysterious and unpredictable person, whose actions may hide not only high ideals, but also hidden that as it may, Musk remains one of the most influential and talked about people on the planet. Conspiracy theories about him can be both fiction and the basis for serious thinking about the impact of big technology on the future of humanity. Without clear answers to all the questions that arise around his figure, we can only watch as Musk continues to write his story and change the technological landscape, sometimes hiding deeper and more complex ideas behind Musk: Village fool, ignorant, raider and plagiaristElon Musk is a figure who causes a huge amount of controversy. While to some he is a visionary changing the world through his innovative companies, to others his reputation is far from impeccable. There is an opinion that Musk is not as brilliant as he is portrayed, and his successes are often the result of raiding, plagiarism and fool and ignoramusMusk often positions himself as a self-starter who, despite not having a significant background in engineering or physics, has been able to build global companies. However, it is worth noting that Musk has a bachelor\'s degree in economics and physics, which for many is not at all an indicator of true technical competence. His university training might have prevented him from taking on such an ambitious role if not for his ability to manipulate money, marketing and public Musk regularly touts his involvement in scientific discoveries and technological breakthroughs, the real technical work at his companies is performed by highly trained engineers and scientists. Musk, in fact, remains only the face and main organizer of the processes, which does not exclude the possibility that his personal contribution to the companys technical solutions is limited. One might ask: How much does a CEO really understand the intricacies of engineering work if his education does not have a corresponding emphasis on the technical side?Raider and plagiaristMusk is also often criticized for his aggressive business policies and accusations of hostile takeovers. His success in creating companies such as PayPal, Tesla and SpaceX was possible in large part due to his ability to capture other people\'s ideas and bring them to mass production, which gives rise to accusations of for example, PayPal, which Musk joined in 1999 and later sold to eBay. PayPal was originally founded by Max Levchin, Peter Thiel and Luke Nosek. Musk, despite making a minor contribution to the technology itself, won the right to become the leader of the company and sold it for billions of dollars. Many argue that Musk simply used other people\'s ideas, brought them to successful implementation, and then simply monetized someone else\'s work. He portrays his role in PayPal\'s success as much larger than it actually less controversial is his attitude towards Tesla and SpaceX. Tesla, despite the fact that Musk entered the company at an early stage, was not its founder. The founders of the company were engineer Martin Eberhard and entrepreneur JB Strobel, who created the first electric car based on their own design. Musk, having joined the company, actively took on the role of leader, promoting it as his own brainchild, which is sometimes forgotten by many fans and the or another deception?Musk is very adept at selling great ideas and projects using charisma and PR strategy, but many of his ambitious statements hide concepts that are not always feasible or often simple. For example, Neuralink, a project to implant chips in the brain, in which Musk is very enthusiastically promoting the idea of connecting a person with a computer, is at the testing stage and very far from mass which has promised to revolutionize the auto industry, faces challenges related to vehicle quality, Autopilot and regulatory threats. Given that Musk often claims achievements that later fall short of reality, his reputation is one of being more about marketing than actual technological is a controversial figure. For some, he is a charismatic leader, a symbol of the new technological world; for others, he is a fraudster and manipulator, using other people\'s ideas to achieve his own goals. Of course, Musk continues to influence the world of high technology, but his successes are often explained not so much by his genius as by his ability to present money profitably and invest it correctly. The question is how long his projects will live up to their big Musk: Pyramid on tech geeks and rich sonsElon Musk is not just an entrepreneur and innovator, as he is often portrayed in the media. His image as a brilliant inventor and visionary of the future is more reminiscent of a pyramid built on tech geeks and rich sons than the result of genuine scientific on technogicsMusk has always been able to cleverly use the people around him to achieve his goals. His companies are excellent examples of how he builds pyramids in which he ends up at the top, but they are created at the expense of equally talented, but less visible people. This is especially evident in projects such as Tesla and for example, began as an idea of engineers, not Musk. Many of them, such as engineer J.B. Strobel and company founder Martin Eberhard, developed the basis of electric vehicle technology. Musk came in at a later stage and managed to invest money and also push the company to the forefront, allowing him to stand out as its leader. But it\'s worth asking: To what extent was Musk a true innovator in creating Tesla? Of course, he became the face of the company, but all technical achievements do not rest on his shoulders, and most of the decisions and technological breakthroughs belong to his team of situation with SpaceX also points to similar points. Musk invested money in the company and became its head, but the main achievements in the field of space technology were carried out by experienced engineers and scientists. Musk has often claimed to be a person who sees the future, but the real work on the ground is done by other is essentially building a pyramid with himself at the top and real engineers, scientists and employees doing the dirty work. In this regard, his success is mainly based on creating an image as a brilliant businessman, rather than on his technical sons and capital manipulationAnother key part of Musk\'s success is his relationships with ""rich sons"" - people with large financial resources who can invest in high-risk projects. Musk is neither the first nor the last to attract such capital to implement his ideas. But it is important to note that it was the ability to find rich investors and manipulate them that became his main strong point at the start of his PayPal example perfectly illustrates how Musk became part of a team already working on a payment system. In this case, he was not the founder, but managed to invest money and then sell the company for billions. PayPal was sold to eBay in 2002, allowing Musk to become one of the most famous entrepreneurs of the time. However, other people played a key role in creating the company, and Musk, as a strategist and businessman, simply launched it in the right ability to raise capital and leverage his connections is what brought Musk success in the first place, not his outstanding engineering or scientific achievements. In addition, his career is closely connected with venture capital and investments of large players. Musk has skillfully played the field of financial manipulation, which is certainly an important part of his The Phantom of GeniusSo who is really behind Elon Musk\'s successes? It is more of a pyramid, where he acts as the face to whom the world\'s attention is directed, while the real achievements belong to the engineers and scientists. Musk may not be a genius in the traditional sense, but he is a master of capital manipulation, image-building, and the ability to cleverly attract public success most likely lies in the area of marketing and PR rather than in the area of actual scientific discoveries or technological breakthroughs. Musk is not so much a brilliant inventor as a high-class strategist who knows how to profitably use other peoples ideas, technologies and money in order to build his own Musk and technocratic fascism: the philosophy of technocratfascismElon Musk, as the leader of the most innovative and ambitious technologies of our time, inevitably finds himself at the center of discussions about the future of humanity. But what if we consider his achievements and ideas in the context of a darker and more dangerous philosophy, such as technocratic fascism?Technocratic fascism, although not an official political ideology, represents a certain fusion of high technology and authoritarian, even totalitarian, forms of government. In this context, Musk, whose companies may represent the future of humanity, becomes a figure who, in his actions and ideas, can be interpreted as part of this as the leader of technocratic fascismWhen we talk about technocratic fascism, we must understand that it is not simply a combination of technology and fascist ideologies. This is the desire to create a society where technology and its development determine the rules of life, and science and progress become instruments of political as a person who, on the one hand, embodies advanced technologies, and on the other, actively uses his influence to promote his projects, can be perceived as a new type of prince of technology. In his desire to create ""colonies on Mars"" or a ""global Internet"" through Starlink, Musk evokes the philosophy proposed by technocrats: using science and technology for global control. He is on the verge of creating a new type of society, in which power belongs to corporations, not states, where progress dictates standards of life, not the choice of the actively supports the concept of creating a post-government world, where private companies such as his Tesla and SpaceX are the most important players on the world stage. This turns Musk into an ideologist who, instead of national interests and democratic processes, primarily protects and promotes the interests of high-tech corporations, turning them into new centers of philosophyThe philosophy of technocrat-fascism has its roots in theories that argue that science and technology should not be used to improve people\'s lives, but to establish and maintain a strict hierarchy. Here, as a rule, technology becomes a tool to simplify control and aligned with these ideas often argue that older forms of governmentdemocracies or authoritarian statesare no longer capable of effectively coping with the challenges of modern times, particularly global issues such as climate change, technology, and artificial intelligence. In their ideal, society should be governed by principles of rationality and efficiency, with power vested in experts, scientists and technocrats rather than elected representatives of the in this context involves a mixture of authoritarian control and ultra-efficient technologies that are used to implement aggressive social and economic policies. It aims to create a power-friendly society where citizens become less important than technologies controlled by powerful corporations. This may include digital surveillance, control of personal data, the mandatory introduction of technology into everyday life and, as a result, the complete subordination of people to a system that is increasingly becoming a system of total surveillance and as philosophers of fascismPhilosophers who support the idea of technocracy actively develop this theory. Among them are figures like Hubert D. Stevenson and other representatives of the early technocratic movements of the 20th century, who argued that a better and fairer society could be achieved through highly efficient technologies. However, if you delve deeper into their ideas, there is often an element of totalitarian idea of a global network and world government, which Musk is actively promoting, is also not alien to technocratic philosophers. They believe that with the help of such systems it is possible to achieve global control and stability. However, this conceals the threat of creating new forms of power in which human rights can easily be and his influence on societyMusk\'s actions, especially in the context of SpaceX and Tesla, with their ambitions to control global infrastructure (for example, through the Starlink satellite network), can be seen as steps towards the creation of technocratic fascism. Musk is building a world in which he and his companies become major players on a planetary level, and the rest of society comes under his of classic government control over technology, we are faced with the creation of global corporations that can dictate the rules of life for everyone, where the power of corporations, not states, becomes the basis for building a new world order. This is the ideal of technocratic fascism, where science and technology become not just tools of progress, but also tools of global Musk, thanks to his ambitious projects and vision of the future, has become the center of interest not only as a businessman and inventor, but also as a possible representative of technocratic fascism. By building pyramids of technology and investment, he is shaping a future in which global corporations can become major players in governing the planet. His ideas about global control, innovation and high technology could become the basis for a new type of authoritarian society, where the role of the ordinary person will be significantly Conspiracy: who came first - technofascist billionaires or donated Republicans?The question of who was the first to create a shadowy conspiracy that teeters on the brink of high technology and political power is of interest not only among politicians and economists, but also among activists, journalists and sociologists. At first glance, the two sidesbillionaires building technocratic empires and political factions using finance to achieve powerappear to operate in different spheres. However, if you conduct a deep analysis of their interactions and goals, you can see interesting intersections that sometimes lead to joint interests and even coordination of Billionaires: The BeginningWhen it comes to technofascist billionaires, the most prominent figures are people like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. These entrepreneurs are not only creating revolutionary technologies, but are also actively introducing themselves into areas that until recently were considered the prerogative of government agencies. Musk, for example, promotes ideas for the colonization of Mars, and his SpaceX and Tesla projects make him one of the most influential people in the world of technology. These companies, despite their apparent independence, often find themselves closely tied to government programs and funding. In this context, the question arises as to how much such independence really is independence when we consider interactions with governments and large ideology of technocracy, as a form of authoritarian control, supported by high technologies and new social structures, is becoming increasingly noticeable in their activities. It is understood that billionaires, possessing not only funds, but also technological power, are able to implement their ideas on a global level, dictating living conditions not only for citizens, but also for entire countries. In this context, ""technofascism"" can be seen as a philosophy where the power of corporations, rather than popular representatives, determines the future of on donations: financing politicsOn the other hand, it is worth considering political parties and their influence through funding. In recent decades, the role of private donations and donations in the US political sphere, in particular in the Republican Party, has increased significantly. It\'s worth noting here that many major donors, such as the Koch brothers, have actively influenced political campaigns by supporting specific candidates, parties, and legislative initiatives. These billionaires are often involved not only in supporting elections, but also in shaping the global political agenda, especially on issues related to tax breaks, deregulation and climate it is precisely these financiers who begin to introduce technocratic solutions into politics, supporting ideas about minimizing government intervention in the economy, attracting investment in high-tech industries and stimulating the growth of corporations, which, in turn, begin to influence the life of entire states. The key point is that Republicans who receive money from such donors can support anti-government and anti-corporate initiatives, while in practice strengthening the position of corporate elites and helping them increase of interestsAt first glance, technofascist billionaires and donation Republicans may seem like two completely different groups, but in reality their interests often overlap. Musk and other technocrats cannot do without political support when developing their projects, including from those who finance Republican campaigns. It is also worth considering that political groups that receive money from such philanthropists often support technocratic initiatives aimed at reducing the role of the state in the economy and developing new technologies that are designed to solve global is important to emphasize here that Republicans, on whom many of these billionaires rely for financial support, often propose solutions that strengthen the position of large corporations and reduce the role of the state in regulating new technologies and economic processes. For example, in the United States, there is active discussion about how taxation and innovation controls can be optimized to stimulate the growth of large technology companies such as Tesla or was the first?Thus, the question of who was first - technofascist billionaires or donation-based Republicans - does not have a clear answer. Both of these phenomena arose simultaneously, since each of them cannot exist without the support of the other. Billionaires seeking to create a technocratic society need political support, which in turn often comes through donations and political influence. On the other hand, Republicans and their political campaigns would not be as successful without the active support and investment of large corporations and billionaires who are interested in minimizing government interference in their can be said that billionaires and Republicans, operating through shadow mechanisms, actively support each other. These shadow conspiracies create a symbiotic relationship where the economic power of tech giants and the political influence of corporations intertwine, creating the basis for technocratic fascism. Such an alliance has a huge impact on world politics, as it helps strengthen the position of large corporations and reduce the role of the state in the economy and summary:The future we are building looks bleak as we watch billionaires and political elites unite in their quest for power and control. Technologies that are supposed to serve humanity become tools of manipulation and oppression. The influence of corporations on politics is growing, and every step in the development of high technology seems to be just another step towards strengthening authoritarian tendencies. We can only hope that this government does not get out of control and destroy the very essence of democratic principles and freedom. But, alas, there is little reason for optimism on the summary:However, despite the threatening trends, the world is always full of opportunities for change. We, as a society, are capable of recognizing threats and finding ways to overcome them. Even in the most difficult situations, there is always room for innovation, for the idea of collective progress and justice. Technology can be used for good if society is more attentive than ever to its direction and role in people\'s lives. And, perhaps, it is in confronting dark trends that the strength of a new, fair world will lie, where technology serves the development and well-being of everyone, and not a narrow circle of a select Yuval Noah.
